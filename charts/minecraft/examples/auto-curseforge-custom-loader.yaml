# Example configuration for AUTO_CURSEFORGE with custom modloader versions
#
# This example demonstrates how to override modloader versions when using
# CurseForge modpacks, which is useful when you need a newer Fabric Loader,
# Forge, or NeoForge version than what the modpack originally specified.

minecraftServer:
  # Accept the EULA (required)
  eula: "TRUE"
  
  # Set the server type to AUTO_CURSEFORGE
  type: AUTO_CURSEFORGE
  
  # Configure AUTO_CURSEFORGE settings
  autoCurseForge:
    # CurseForge API key - get from https://console.curseforge.com/
    # IMPORTANT: Store this in a Kubernetes secret in production!
    apiKey:
      key: "your-api-key-here"
    
    # Example: Cobblemon Fabric modpack
    slug: "cobblemon-fabric"
    
    # Override the Fabric loader version from the modpack's default
    # Example: Change from Fabric 0.16.10 to 0.16.14
    fabricLoaderVersion: "0.16.14"
    
    # For Forge modpacks, you could override the Forge version:
    # forgeVersion: "43.2.0"
    
    # For NeoForge modpacks, you could override the NeoForge version:
    # neoforgeVersion: "47.1.99"
